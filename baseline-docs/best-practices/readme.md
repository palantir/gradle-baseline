# Best Practice Guides

**Note:** We encourage experimentation. These are practices that have 
worked for us, determined through experience. You may find that they 
don't work for you. But if you're looking for a starting place for your 
experimentation, we offer you these guides.

Le Corbusier: *Yes, the Parthenon is perhaps the most beautiful instance,
the perfect example of a particular standard of architecture. The
Parthenon may have achieved the platonic ideal of the standard of
architecture weâ€™ve previously established. But there are many possible
standards to acknowledge, each dependent on need and use, and
standards are established by experiment.*
