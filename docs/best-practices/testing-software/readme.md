Software tests validate that newly-written code functions as intended.
Surprisingly, this is *not* the main reason for testing software. More
importantly, **tests ensure that code continues to be correct under
future modifications** and **provide documentation** for the implemented
functionality.

In this guide, we distinguish three types of tests:

- **Unit tests** validate that all code paths of individual functions
  work as expected.
- **Integration tests** verify the interplay of a collection
  of modules.
- **End-to-end (ETE) tests** test entire workflows of a product.

Since the number of possible code paths typically grows exponentially
with size of the tested code base, *exhaustive* tests are only possible
for the smallest code units, typically functions or methods. Integration
and ETE tests can never validate all cases and therefore focus on a
subset of *representative cases*.

## Unit Tests

The examples in this section are written in Java using the standard
[JUnit](http://junit.org/) and [Hamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest)
libraries for which a plethora of
[tutorials](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JUnit/article.html) are
available. Conceptually similar approaches exist in other languages.

Unit tests validate that all code paths of small code units work as
expected:

- Functions or methods that don't depend on a large amount of external
  state (e.g., the state of their class) should be tested for
  parameter combinations that exercise all code paths.
- Methods whose behavior depends strongly on the state of their class
  should be tested for all structurally different states, again in
  order to test all code paths.

If you find that a particular class or method is difficult to test
because you cannot freely set the parameters and state, then this
usually indicates a poorly designed class or code. **Test-driven development**
suggests to *first* write tests and then fill in the implementation; consequently, the
implementation is necessarily designed such that it can be
easily tested. Also see [Writing Testable Code](#writing-testable-code) below.

Unit tests are typically executed before every build, both locally and
on the CI servers. In order to make this feasible, consider the
following guidelines:

- Branches shared by more than one developer (e.g., `develop`,
  `master`, `fix/...`) should never fail unit tests. Your Continuous Integration system should
  refuse to merge a branch with failing tests, and overriding this
  behavior is bad practice.
- Unit tests need to be fast and light on computational resource. In
  particular, do not abuse unit tests for performance tests or testing
  of long-lived services.

Since unit tests guard from regression bugs, be very careful and verify
with the code owner **and users** before you change the behavior of
a unit test. For example, if the author of a sorting algorithm implements
a test that verifies the *stability* of the sorting procedure, do
not remove this test when you implement a performance improvement that cannot always
guarantee that sorting is stable. Users of of the sorting
procedure may rely on its stability and their code will break if
this assumption is violated.

### Writing Effective Unit Tests

**Test public interfaces**. All public interfaces should be covered by
unit tests. Sometimes, internal methods may require additional explicit
tests; in such cases, mark the tested methods package-private and
`@VisibleForTesting`.

**Find reasonable names**. Test names should indicate the tested code
path and the expected functionality; this makes it easy to understand
what exactly got broken by a particular change.

**Make unit test readable**. Since unit tests serve as documentation for
code, they should be easy to read and understand. Testing frameworks
such as JUnit provide static methods that make for very literal testing
code:

``` java
assertThat(MyUtilityClass.upperCase("test string"), is("TEST STRING"));
```

**Test each code path separately**. Each test should exercise one code
path or distinct, atomic behavior.

``` java
// BAD. Don't do this.
@Test
public void testSorting() {
    assertThat(MySort.sort(ImmutableList.<String>of()), is(emptyCollectionOf(String.class)));
    assertThat(MySort.sort(ImmutableList.of("a")), is(ImmutableList.of("a")));
    assertThat(MySort.sort(ImmutableList.of("c", "b", "a")), is(ImmutableList.of("a", "b", "c")));
    assertThat(MySort.sort(ImmutableList.of(3, 2, 1)), is(ImmutableList.of(1, 2, 3)));

    // Test that sorting is stable.
    String a1 = "a";
    String a2 = "a";
    String a3 = "a";
    List<String> sorted = MySort.sort(ImmutableList.of(a1, a2, a3));
    assertSame(a1, sorted.get(0));
    assertSame(a2, sorted.get(1));
    assertSame(a3, sorted.get(2));
}
```

``` java
// Good.
@Test
public void testSorting_emptyList() {
    assertThat(MySort.sort(ImmutableList.<String>of()), is(emptyCollectionOf(String.class)));
}

@Test
public void testSorting_singletonList() {
    assertThat(MySort.sort(ImmutableList.of("a")), is(ImmutableList.of("a")));
}

@Test
public void testSorting_standardCases() {
    assertThat(MySort.sort(ImmutableList.of("c", "b", "a")), is(ImmutableList.of("a", "b", "c")));
    assertThat(MySort.sort(ImmutableList.of(3, 2, 1)), is(ImmutableList.of(1, 2, 3)));
    assertThat(MySort.sort(ImmutableList.of(2, 1, 3)), is(ImmutableList.of(1, 2, 3)));
}

@Test
public void testSorting_isStable() {
    String a1 = "a";
    String a2 = "a";
    String a3 = "a";
    List<String> sorted = MySort.sort(ImmutableList.of(a1, a2, a3));
    assertSame(a1, sorted.get(0));
    assertSame(a2, sorted.get(1));
    assertSame(a3, sorted.get(2));
}
```

It is OK to group several functionally similar test cases in one test:

``` java
@Test
public void testEmailParsing_validAddresses() {
    assertTrue(myParser.isEmailAddress("a@b.com"));
    assertTrue(myParser.isEmailAddress("real.name@company.com"));
    assertTrue(myParser.isEmailAddress("nickname@sub.domain.company.com"));
    assertTrue(myParser.isEmailAddress("name@country-domain.de"));
    // ...
}

@Test
public void testEmailParsing_invalidAddresses() {
    assertFalse(myParser.isEmailAddress(""));
    assertFalse(myParser.isEmailAddress("@"));
    assertFalse(myParser.isEmailAddress("company.com"));
    assertFalse(myParser.isEmailAddress("@company.com"));
    assertFalse(myParser.isEmailAddress("name"));
    assertFalse(myParser.isEmailAddress(null));
    // ...
}
```

**Test standard, edge, and failure cases**. A code unit should be tested
for all error conditions, all edge cases, and a number of "standard
cases." For example, a function
`int[] subtractVectors(int[] left, int[] right)` that computes
`left - right` for two vectors of the same cardinality should contain
tests for:

- Error conditions:
  - `left` and `right` have different sizes
  - at least one of `left` or `right` is `null`
- Edge cases:
  - `left` and `right` have length 0 or 1
  - (arguably: ) a subtraction overflows
- Standard cases: For example:
  - `[2, 4, 9] - [1, 2, 3] == [1, 2, 6]`
  - `[0, 0, 0] - [1, 2, 3] == [-1, -2, -3]`

**Use matchers instead of implementing equals()**. Override `equals()`
when mandated by application or library logic, but *never* implement
`equals()` merely in order to simplify your life in unit tests. Use
Hamcrest matchers instead. This may seem cumbersome at first, but the
net benefit is huge as soon as more than one property of an object is
tested or there is more than one test.

**Use mocks**. Use mock objects to construct the context and state
required to test a particular code path. Mock objects are cheap, fast,
explicit, and concise, and it is almost always more stable and easier to
set up a mock object than to instantiate and populate a full
implementation of a particular class or interface. Testing functionality
with real implementations is the duty of integration or end-to-end
tests. See the section on Writing testable code\_ for an example.

### Writing Testable Code

Further reading: Mi≈°ko Hevery, [Guide: Writing Testable Code](http://misko.hevery.com/code-reviewers-guide/)

---

Making methods, classes, or modules easy to test is a lot of work and
may seem like a cumbersome exercise to a novice. Fortunately and
coincidentally, code that is easy to test is usually considered *better*
along several, not necessarily testing-related, dimensions: it is more
reusable, more modular, easier to understand, easier to refactor, and
less tightly coupled.

Probably the most important design consideration is to **inject
dependencies** into a class through the constructor instead of letting a
class construct its dependencies itself. Let's look at a simple, but
drastic, example:

``` java
public final class Backend {
    private final Database database;

    public Backend(String dbHost, String dbUsername, String dbPassword) {
        this.database = new OracleDatabase(dbHost + ":9271", dbUsername, dbPassword);
    }

    private boolean isValidUser(User user) {
        return user.getAccountExpiryDate().isBeforeNow() && user.isActive();
    }

    public List<String> getValidUsers() {
        List<String> users = Lists.newArrayList();
        for (User u : database.getAllUsers()) {
            if (isValidUser(u)) {
                users.add(u.getUsername());
            }
        }

        return users;
    }
}
```

This class uses a `Database` instance to retrieve `User` objects in the
`getValidUsers()` method; the retrieved users are then filtered down to
the list of active users and returned by their user names. The database
connection is configurable through the `dbHost`, `dbUsername`, and
`dbPassword` parameters that are used to instantiate a corresponding
`OracleDatabase` object. A unit test could look like this:

``` java
@Test
public void testGetValidUsers() {
    Backend backend = new Backend("localhost", "admin", "password");
    assertThat(backend.getValidUsers(), is(ImmutableList.of("vanessa", "peter")));
}
```

Unfortunately, **this is a terrible test** for several reasons:

- Even though the database can be configured through the
  host/username/password parameters, the test can only succeed when a
  valid Oracle database instance is available. Even if this may be the
  case on a development machine, it is probably not on the CI servers.
- It is entirely unclear what the test actually asserts since the
  return value of `getValidUsers()` depends entirely on (a) the
  current time (via `isBeforeNow()` in `isValidUser()`), and (b) the
  contents of the Oracle database. Unit tests need to be
  self-contained and the tested behavior must be self-explanatory.

We can improve the test by first rewriting the code:

``` java
public final class Backend {
    private final Database database;
    private final Predicate<User> validUserFilter;

    @VisibleForTesting
    Backend(Database database, Predicate<User> validUserFilter) {
        this.database = database;
        this.validUserFilter = validUserFilter;
    }

    public List<String> getValidUsers() {
        List<String> users = Lists.newArrayList();
        for (User u : database.getAllUsers()) {
            if (validUserFilter.apply(u)) {
                users.add(u.getUsername());
            }
        }

        return users;
    }
}

/**
 * Factory methods for creating {@link Backend} instances.
 */
public class Backends {
    public static Backend withOracleCredentials(String dbHost, String dbUsername, String dbPassword) {
        Database oracleDatabase = new OracleDatabase(dbHost + ":9271", dbUsername, dbPassword);
        return Backend.withDatabase(oracleDatabase);
    }

    public static Backend withDatabase(Database database) {
        return new Backend(database, new Predicate<User>() {
            @Override
            boolean apply(User user) {
                return user.getAccountExpiryDate().isBeforeNow() && user.isActive();
            }
        );
    }
}
```

We have introduced two important changes:

- The `Database` is injected through the constructor instead of being
  created in the constructor.
- The `isValidUser()` method is now a
  `Predicate<User> validUserFilter`.

Note that the (single) constructor is the most generic way of creating
new Backend instances, and that the constructor does zero work. It may
however be cumbersome and error-prone to use as it requires an
explicitly given `validUserFilter`. In order to make the class easier to
use, we provide two static factory methods, one for creating a Backend
with an Oracle database (`withOracleCredentials(...)`), and one for a
generic Database (`withDatabase(...)`). If we wanted to enforce the use
of the canonical `validUserFilter`, we could mark the constructor
package-private and annotate it with `@VisibleForTesting`; the latter
serves merely as documentation. (C++ has the notion of *friend classes*
\[i.e., "private with exceptions"\] that can be used to statically enforce
that only test classes may use this constructor.)

The refactored class can be tested much more easily because its state
can be constructed explicitly in order to verify a specific code path or
part of the method or class behavior. For example:

``` java
@Mock
public Database mockDatabase;

@Test
public void testGetValidUsers_WhenNoUserInDatabase() {
    when(mockDatabase.getAllUsers()).thenReturn(ImmutableList.<User>of());
    Backend backend = new Backend(mockDatabase, Predicates.alwaysTrue());
    assertThat(backend.getValidUsers(), is(emptyCollectionOf(String.class)));
}

@Test
public void testGetValidUsers_ExpiredUsersAreNotReturned() {
    when(mockDatabase.getAllUsers()).thenReturn(ImmutableList.of(
        new User("vanessa", DateTime.now().plusDays(1)),
        new User("peter", DateTime.now().plusDays(2)),
        new User("jack", DateTime.now().minusDays(1)) // account expires 1 day before test runs
    ));
    Backend backend = Backend.withDatabase(mockDatabase);
    assertThat(backend.getValidUsers(), is(ImmutableList.of("vanessa", "peter")));
}

...
```

Note that through dependency injection, we are able to programmatically
construct a "database" that contains exactly the records we need in
order to test certain code paths. For example, we can dynamically assign
account expiry dates. As promised earlier, the class is now more
flexible and less tightly coupled to a particular database
implementation (e.g., `OracleDatabase`).
