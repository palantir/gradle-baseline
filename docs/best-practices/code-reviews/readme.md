too. Long story short, this document presents Palantir's take on code reviews.
Organizations with deep cultural reluctance to peer reviews may want to consult
Karl E. Wiegers' excellent essay on [Humanizing Peer Reviews](http://www.processimpact.com/articles/humanizing_reviews.html) before trying to follow this guide.

## Motivation

We perform code reviews (CRs) in order to improve code quality and benefit from
[positive effects on team and company
culture](https://blog.fullstory.com/what-we-learned-from-google-code-reviews-arent-just-for-catching-bugs).
For example:

- **Committers are motivated** by the notion of a set
  of reviewers who will look over the change request: the committer tends to
  clean up loose ends, consolidate TODOs, and generally improve the commit.
  Recognition of coding expertise through peers is a source of pride 
  for many programmers.

- **Sharing knowledge** helps development teams in several ways:

  - A CR explicitly communicates added/altered/removed functionality to
    team members who can subsequently build on the work done.

  - The committer may use a technique or algorithm that reviewers can
    learn from. More generally, code reviews help [raise the quality bar across the organization](https://blog.fullstory.com/what-we-learned-from-google-code-reviews-arent-just-for-catching-bugs/).

  - Reviewers may possess knowledge about programming techniques or the code base that can help
    improve or consolidate the change; for example, someone else may be
    concurrently working on a similar feature or fix.

  - Positive interaction and communication strengthens social bonds between
    team members.

- **Consistency** in a code base makes code easier to read and
  understand, helps prevent bugs, and facilitates collaboration
  between regular and migratory developer species.

- **Legibility** of code fragments is hard to judge for the author
  whose brain child it is, and easy to judge for a reviewer who does
  not have the full context. Legible code is more reusable, bug-free,
  and future-proof.

- **Accidental errors** (e.g., typos) as well as **structural errors**
  (e.g., dead code, logic or algorithm bugs, performance or architecture
  concerns) are often much easier to
  spot for critical reviewers with an outside perspective.
  Studies have found that even short and informal code reviews have significant
  [impact on code quality and bug frequency](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-reviews-just-do-it/).

- **Compliance** and regulatory environments often demand reviews. CRs are a
  great way to avoid common security traps. If your feature or environment has
  significant security requirements it will benefit from (and probably require)
  review by your local security curmudgeons ([OWASP's
  guide](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Code_Review_Introduction) is a good
  example of the process).

## What to review

There is no eternally true answer to this question and each development team 
should agree on its own approach. Some teams prefer
to review every change merged into the main branch, while others will have a
"triviality" threshold under which a review is not required. The
trade-off is between effective use of engineers' (both authors' and
reviewers') time and maintaining code quality. In certain regulatory environments,
code review may be required even for trivial changes.

Code reviews are classless: being the most senior person on the team does not
imply that your code does not need review. Even if, in the rare case, code is
flawless, the review provides an opportunity for mentorship and collaboration,
and, minimally, diversifies the understanding of code in the code base. 


## When to review

Code reviews should happen after automated checks (tests, style, other CI)
have completed successfully, but before the code merges to the repository's
mainline branch. We generally don't perform formal code review of aggregate
changes since the last release.

For complex changes that should merge into the mainline branch as a single unit
but are too large to fit into one reasonable CR, consider a stacked CR model:
Create a primary branch `feature/big-feature` and a number of secondary branches
(e.g., `feature/big-feature-api`, `feature/big-feature-testing`, etc.) that
each encapsulate a subset of the functionality and that get individually
code-reviewed against the `feature/big-feature` branch. Once all secondary
branches are merged into `feature/big-feature`, create a CR for merging the
latter into the main branch.


## Preparing code for review

It is the author's responsibility to submit CRs that are easy to review in order
not to waste reviewers' time and motivation:

- **Scope and size:** Changes should have a narrow, well-defined, self-contained
  scope that they cover exhaustively. For example, a change may implement
  a new feature or fix a bug. Shorter changes are preferred over
  longer ones. If a CR makes substantive changes to more than ~5
  files, or took longer than 1-2 days to write, or would take more
  than 20 minutes to review, consider splitting it into multiple self-contained CRs.
  For example, a developer can submit one change that
  defines the API for a new feature in terms of interfaces and
  documentation, and a second change that adds implementations for
  those interfaces.

- Only submit **complete**, **self-reviewed** (by diff), and **self-tested** CRs.
  In order to save reviewers' time, test the submitted changes (i.e., run the test suite)
  and make sure they pass all builds as well as all tests and code quality
  checks, both locally and on the CI servers, *before assigning
  reviewers*.

- **Refactoring CRs:** Refactoring CRs should not alter behavior;
  conversely, a behavior-changing CR should avoid refactoring and code
  formatting changes. There are multiple good reasons for this:

  - Refactoring CRs often touch many lines and files and will consequently be
    [reviewed with less attention](https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/best-practices-for-peer-code-review/).
    Unintended behavior changes can leak into the code base without anyone noticing.

  - Large refactoring CRs break cherry-picking,
    rebasing, and other source control magic. It is very onerous to undo a
    behavior change that was introduced as part of a repository-wide
    refactoring commit.

  - Expensive human review time should be spent on the program logic
    rather than style, syntax, or formatting debates. We prefer settling
    those with automated tooling like
    [Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/),
    [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint),
    [Baseline](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-baseline),
    [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier),
    etc.


## Commit messages

The following is an example of a good commit message following a [widely quoted standard](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html):

```
Capitalized, short (80 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 120 characters or so. In some contexts, the first
line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body. The blank line separating the
summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run
the two together.

Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches
up with commit messages generated by commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, followed by a single space, with blank lines in between,
    but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent
```

Try to describe both **what** the commit changes and **how** it does it:

```
> BAD. Don't do this.
Make compile again

> Good.
Add jcsv dependency to fix IntelliJ compilation
```


## Finding reviewers

It is customary for the committer to propose one or two reviewers who are
familiar with the code base. Often, one of the reviewers is the project lead or
a senior engineer. Project owners should consider subscribing to their projects
in order to get notified of new CRs. Code reviews among more than three
parties are often unproductive or even counter-productive since different
reviewers may propose contradictory changes. This may indicate fundamental
disagreement on the correct implementation and should be resolved outside a code
review in a higher-bandwidth forum, for example in person or in a video
conference with all involved parties.


## Performing code reviews

A code review is a synchronization point among different
team members and thus has the potential to block progress.
Consequently, code reviews need to be prompt (on the order of
hours, not days), and team members and leads need to be aware of
the time commitment and prioritize review time accordingly. If you
don't think you can complete a review in time, please let the committer
know right away so they can find someone else.

A review should be thorough enough that the reviewer could explain the change at
a reasonable level of detail to another developer. This ensures that the details
of the code base are known to more than a single person.

As a reviewer, it is your responsibility to enforce coding standards and
keep the quality bar up. Reviewing code is more of an art than a
science. The only way to learn it is to do it; an experienced
reviewer should consider putting other less experienced reviewers on
their changes and have them do a review first. Assuming the author has
followed the guidelines above (especially with respect to self-review
and ensuring the code runs), here's an list of things a reviewer should
pay attention to in a code review:

### Purpose

- **Does this code accomplish the author's purpose?** Every change should
  have a specific reason (new feature, refactor, bugfix, etc). Does the
  submitted code actually accomplish this purpose?

- **Ask questions.** Functions and classes should exist for a reason.
  When the reason is not clear to the reviewer, this may be an indication
  that the code needs to be rewritten or supported with comments or tests.

### Implementation

- **Think about how you would have solved the problem.** If it's
  different, why is that? Does your code handle more (edge) cases? Is it
  shorter/easier/cleaner/faster/safer yet functionally equivalent? Is there
  some underlying pattern you spotted that isn't captured by the
  current code?

- **Do you see potential for useful abstractions?** Partially duplicated code
  often indicates that a more abstract or general piece of functionality
  can be extracted and then reused in different contexts.

- **Think like an adversary.** Try to "catch" authors taking shortcuts or
  missing cases by coming up with problematic configurations/input
  data that breaks their code.

- **Think about libraries or existing product code.** When someone
  re-implements existing functionality, more often than not it's
  simply because they don't know it already exists. Sometimes, code
  or functionality is duplicated on purpose, e.g., in order to avoid
  dependencies. In such cases, a code comment can clarify the intent.
  Is the introduced functionality already provided by an existing library?

- **Does the change follow standard patterns?** Established code bases
  often exhibit patterns around naming conventions, program logic
  decomposition, data type definitions, etc. It is usually desirable
  that changes are implemented in accordance with existing patterns.

- **Does the change add compile-time or run-time dependencies (especially
  between sub-projects)?** We want to keep our products loosely coupled,
  with as few dependencies as possible. Changes to dependencies and the
  build system should be scrutinized heavily.

### Legibility and style

- **Think about your reading experience.** Did you grasp the concepts in a
  reasonable amount of time? Was the flow sane and were variable and methods names
  easy to follow? Were you able to keep track through multiple files or functions?
  Were you put off by inconsistent naming?

- **Does the code adhere to coding guidelines and code style?** Is the
  code consistent with the project in terms of style, API conventions,
  etc.? As mentioned above, we prefer to settle style debates with automated
  tooling.

- **Does this code have TODOs?** TODOs just pile up in code, and become
  stale over time. Have the author submit a ticket on GitHub Issues or JIRA and
  attach the issue number to the TODO. The proposed code change should not contain
  commented-out code.

### Maintainability

- **Read the tests.** If there are no tests and there should be, ask the
  author to write some. Truly untestable features are rare, while untested
  implementations of features are unfortunately common. Check the tests
  themselves: are they covering interesting cases? Are they readable?
  Does the CR lower overall test coverage? Think of ways this code
  could break. Style standards for tests are often different than core
  code, but still important.

- **Does this CR introduce the risk of breaking test code, staging stacks,
  or integrations tests?** These are often not checked as part of the
  pre-commit/merge checks, but having them go down is painful
  for everyone. Specific things to look for are: removal of test
  utilities or modes, changes in configuration, and changes in
  artifact layout/structure.

- **Does this change break backward compatibility?** If so, is it OK to
  merge the change at this point or should it be pushed into a later release?
  Breaks can include database or schema changes, public API changes, 
  user workflow changes, etc.

- **Does this code need integration tests?** Sometimes, code can't
  be adequately tested with unit tests alone, especially if the code
  interacts with outside systems or configuration. 

- **Leave feedback on code-level documentation, comments, and commit messages.**
  Redundant comments clutter the code, and terse commit messages
  mystify future contributors. This isn't always applicable, but quality
  comments and commit messages will pay for themselves down the line.
  (Think of a time you saw an excellent, or truly terrible, commit
  message or comment.)

- **Was the external documentation updated?**
  If your project maintains a README, CHANGELOG, or other documentation,
  was it updated to reflect the changes? Outdated documentation can be
  more confusing than none, and it will be more costly to fix it in the
  future than to update it now.

Don't forget to praise concise/readable/efficient/elegant code. Conversely,
declining or disapproving a CR is not rude. If the change is redundant or
irrelevant, decline it with an explanation. If you consider it unacceptable due
to one or more fatal flaws, disapprove it, again with an explanation. Sometimes
the right outcome of a CR is "let's do this a totally different way" or even
"let's not do this at all."

Be respectful to the reviewees. While adversarial thinking is handy,
it's not your feature and you can't make all the decisions. If you
can't come to an agreement with your reviewee with the code as is,
switch to real-time communication or seek a third opinion.

### Security

Verify that API endpoints perform appropriate authorization and authentication
consistent with the rest of the code base. Check for other common weaknesses,
e.g., weak configuration, malicious user input, missing log events, etc. When in
doubt, refer the CR to an application security expert.

### Comments: concise, friendly, actionable

Reviews should be concise and written in neutral language. Critique the code,
not the author. When something is unclear, ask for clarification rather than
assuming ignorance. Avoid possessive pronouns, in particular in conjunction with
evaluations: "*my* code worked before *your* change", "*your* method has a bug",
etc. Avoid absolute judgements: "this can *never* work", "the result is *always*
wrong".

Try to differentiate between suggestions (e.g., "Suggestion: extract
method to improve legibility"), required changes (e.g., "Add @Override"), and
points that need discussion or clarification (e.g., "Is this really the correct
behavior? If so, please add a comment explaining the logic."). Consider providing
links or pointers to in-depth explanations of a problem.

When you're done with a code review, indicate to what extent you expect the
author to respond to your comments and whether you would like to re-review the
CR after the changes have been implemented (e.g., "Feel free to merge after
responding to the few minor suggestions" vs. "Please consider my suggestions and
let me know when I can take another look.").

### Responding to reviews

Part of the purpose of the code review is improve the author's change request;
consequently, don't be offended by your reviewer's suggestions and take them
seriously even if you don't agree. Respond to every comment, even if it's only a
simple "ACK" or "done." Explain why you made certain decisions, why some
function exists, etc. If you can't come to an agreement with the reviewer,
switch to real-time communication or seek an outside opinion.

Fixes should be pushed to the same branch, but in a separate commit. Squashing
commits during the review process makes it hard for the reviewer to follow up
on changes.

Different teams have different merge policies: some teams allow only project
owners to merge, while other teams allow the contributor to merge after a positive
code review.

### In-person code reviews
For the majority of code reviews, asynchronous diff-based tools such as
Reviewable, Gerrit or, GitHub are a great choice. Complex changes, or reviews
between parties with very different expertise or experience can be more
efficient when performed in person, either in front of the same screen or
projector, or remotely via VTC or screen share tools.


## Examples

In the following examples, suggested review comments are indicated by
`//R: ...` comments in the code blocks.

### Inconsistent naming

```java
class MyClass {
    private int countTotalPageVisits; //R: name variables consistently
    private int uniqueUsersCount;
}
```

### Inconsistent method signatures

```java
interface MyInterface {
    /** Returns {@link Optional#empty} if string cannot be extracted. */
    public Optional<String> extractString(String s);

    /** Returns null if {@code s} cannot be rewritten. */
    public String rewriteString(String s); //R: should harmonize return values: use Optional<> here, too?
}
```

### Library use

```java
//R: remove and replace by Guava's MapJoiner
String joinAndConcatenate(Map<String, String> map, String keyValueSeparator, String keySeparator);
```

### Personal taste

```java
int dayCount; //R: nit: I usually prefer numFoo over fooCount; up to you, but we should keep it consistent in this project
```

### Architectural concerns

```java
otherService.call(); //R: I think we should avoid the dependency on OtherService. Can we discuss this in person?
```
