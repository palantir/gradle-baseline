## [Java Style Guide](java-style-guide/readme.md)
Code is more often read than written. Style guides exist to make reading code more pleasant and efficient by
standardizing formatting. Whether you follow our style guides precisely or use them as the basis for your
own, you will find that using a style guide makes developing software in a team easier.

## [Best Practices](best-practices/readme.md)
The best practices described here were collected and honed by developers at Palantir. Whether
youâ€™re just starting a new project and wondering what tooling to use, want to get better at
giving code reviews, or are trying to improve your test coverage, you can benefit from others
who have done it before.
