  description: Error Prone StringBuilderConstantParameters. StringBuilder with a constant
    number of parameters should be replaced by simple concatenation. The Java compiler
    (jdk8) replaces concatenation of a constant number of arguments with a StringBuilder,
    while jdk 9+ take advantage of JEP 280 (https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/280) to
    efficiently pre-size the result for better performance than a StringBuilder.
