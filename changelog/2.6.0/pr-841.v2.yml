  description: Added a new ErrorProne check `PreferAssertj` to assist migration to AssertJ from
    legacy test frameworks. It may be necessary to add a dependency on `org.assertj:assertj-core`
    in modules which do not already depend on AssertJ. If there's a technical reason that AssertJ
    cannot be used, `PreferAssertj` may be explicitly disabled to prevent future upgrades from
    attempting to re-run the migration.
