    If a subclass of FilterOutputStream implements `void write(int)`, they
    should also override `void write(byte[], int, int)`, otherwise the
    performance of the stream is likely to be slow.

    See https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/FilterOutputStream.html#write(byte%5B%5D,int,int)
    > Subclasses of FilterOutputStream should provide a more efficient implementation of this method.
