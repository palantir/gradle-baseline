    PreferAssertj disallows `assert` statements in test code.

    Tests should use more specific AssertJ checks, which cannot be disabled by turning off asserts. Arguably the `assert` keyword should never be used, preferring preconditions allowing production environments to avoid invoking code paths that are impossible to test.
