    Implement error prone ReverseDnsLookup for unexpected reverse dns lookups

    Calling address.getHostName may result in a DNS lookup which is a network request,
    making the invocation significantly more expensive than expected depending on the
    environment.
    This check  is intended to be advisory - it's fine to
    @SuppressWarnings("ReverseDnsLookup") in certain cases, but is usually not
    recommended.
