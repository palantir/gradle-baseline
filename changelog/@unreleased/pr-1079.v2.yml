    Error prone `AssertjPrimitiveComparison` for primitive comparisons

    Prefer using AssertJ fluent comparisons over logic in an assertThat
    statement for better failure output. assertThat(a == b).isTrue()
    failures report 'expected true' where assertThat(a).isEqualTo(b)
    provides the expected and actual values.
