    Disallow dangling parenthesis

    ## Before this PR
    Generally our style has always been to disallow dangling parenthesis, but nothing applies this rule.

    The aim of this PR, and any style PR, is to increase consistency of coding style and reduce time spent in CR commenting with stylistic nit picks.

    ```java
    Preconditions.checkArgument(
        myExpression,
        "My expression isn't as true as it should be"
    );
    ```

    ## After this PR
    ```java
    Preconditions.checkArgument(
        myExpression,
        "My expression isn't as true as it should be");
    ```
