  description: The threshold for automatic on demand imports (.* imports) in IntelliJ and
    Eclipse formatter configurations has been increased from 99 to 999. Ideally on demands imports
    would be disabled completely as they are not allowed in the baseline Checkstyle configuration.
    Given that's not possible, the threshold is being icreased as a workaround.
