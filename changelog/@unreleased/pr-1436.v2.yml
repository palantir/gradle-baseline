  description: A new checkstyle regex 'PreferInclusiveLanguage' spots usages of the
    words 'whitelist', 'blacklist', 'slave' and suggests words that don't have any
    racial undertones. This check is intended to guide users when names are initially
    chosen (as this is often easier than renaming things later) - users can add `@SuppressWarnings("PreferInclusiveLanguage")`
    if it's not practical to fix these straight away.
