    Disable FallThrough on Java 14 for switch expressions

    ## Before this PR
    There is a false negative with `FallThrough` on Java 14 when using switch expressions where the case arms are statements (as opposed to expressions).

    See https://github.com/google/error-prone/issues/1649.

    ## After this PR
    Disable `FallThrough` on Java 14 source to avoid false positives
