  description: "Enable applying refaster rules for repos with -Xlint:deprecation\n\n##
    Before this PR\nIf a repository configures -Werror or -Xlint:deprecation, then
    the refaster refactoring can fail before its had a chance to refactor the code
    away from the deprecated method.\n \n## After this PR\nWe disable these checks
    when applying the refaster refactorings such that the refactoring is applied."
