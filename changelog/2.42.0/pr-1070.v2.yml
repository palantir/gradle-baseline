  description: |-
    Improve `NonComparableStreamSort` to validate that stream types implement comparable, as opposed to validating that casting to comparable does not cause a compiler error.

    This commit reduces the severity to WARNING because it's
    possible that the check will flag code that happens to work
    today, but we strongly recommend against sorting streams of
    a type that is not directly comparable without a custom
    comparator because it is likely to break later due to lack
    of enforcement by the type system.
